## Overview

### Project Overview

Pazoo revolutionizes password security by enabling users to transform simple, weak passwords into robust and secure versions through a unique and engaging method. The core functionality of Pazoo involves the user interacting with animal icons, each corresponding to a unique mathematical function. This process strengthens the original password by adding complexity and variability, making it much harder for unauthorized parties to compromise. This innovative approach blends the security benefits of traditional password managers with the personal customization and simplicity of managing your own passwords.

I designed Pazoo to be intuitive and user-friendly, yet highly secure. It operates completely locally within the user’s browser, eliminating the need for external infrastructure. Its open-source nature ensures transparency and encourages community-driven enhancements, positioning it as an ideal alternative to traditional password managers that may face security vulnerabilities and cross-platform issues.

With Pazoo, users gain the ability to generate and maintain strong, consistent passwords across different devices, enhancing their digital security with ease.

### How It Works

Pazoo operates on a straightforward yet powerful principle: transforming user-provided passwords into highly secure ones through a series of hash functions represented by animal icons. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. Initial Password Entry: The user starts by entering a weak, easily memorable password into the input field on the website.

2. Animal Selection: The user selects a sequence of animal icons, each corresponding to a specific hash function. The positions and functions of these animals are fixed to ensure consistency.

3. Password Transformation: Each selected animal applies its hash function to the password sequentially, enhancing the password's complexity and security with each step. The hash functions used take a deliberate amount of time to compute, which adds an additional layer of security by significantly slowing down any potential brute-force attacks.

4. Final Strong Password: The final, highly secure password can then be copied and used on any platform.

Important note: Pazoo does not store any passwords or user data. The entire transformation process happens locally in the user's browser, ensuring privacy and security.

## Transformation Process

_In this section, I outline how the system behind Pazoo operates, giving you insight into the underlying mechanisms that empower the tool. This information is vital for understanding how your passwords are transformed and ensures you can independently manage your password security if necessary, such as in the event that the website becomes unavailable. Gaining familiarity with these processes allows you to maintain robust password security on your own terms._

### Animal Node Functions: How Each Animal Enhances Password Security

Pazoo employs a unique system of animal nodes to represent different hash functions, each with a specific position and associated salt value. This innovative approach allows you to transform an initial password into a highly secure one efficiently.

Here’s how each component of the animal nodes contributes to the password transformation process:

1. Position: Each animal holds a fixed position within the sequence, which guarantees that using the same sequence will consistently generate the same secure password from a given initial password. This consistency aids in memory retention, as users can rely on visual and kinesthetic memory to recall their specific sequence through repeated interactions.

2. Salt Value: Attached to each animal node is a unique salt value that mixes with the previous password before hashing. This ensures diverse and unique hash outputs for each animal selected.

3. Hash Function: Each animal node triggers a specific hash function, which is a cryptographic algorithm that transforms the entered password into a standardized 43-character string. Pazoo employs the Argon2 hash function, known for its memory-intensive properties, which slow down brute-force attacks by requiring more computational resources and time to decipher.

4. Prefix Addition: At the completion of each hash transformation, a prefix 'Z#' is added to the beginning of the resulting password. This ensures that each password contains a capital letter and a special character. Additionally, this prefix helps users recognize that the password was generated using Pazoo, adding an extra layer of organization and consistency.

Below is a table listing all the animal nodes along with their positions and salt values:

### Hash Function Configuration

Pazoo employs the Argon2 hash function to transform passwords into secure, robust ones. Argon2 is a memory-intensive cryptographic algorithm designed to resist both GPU and ASIC attacks, making it suitable for password hashing. Below are the specific settings configured within each hash function in Pazoo to ensure optimal security:

- pass: The previous or initial password input by the user, which serves as the base for hashing.
- salt: A unique salt value associated with each animal node. It ensures that each animal node produces different passwords when selected.
- time: The time cost parameter, set to 3, defines the number of iterations the hashing algorithm performs. Higher values increase the computation time, enhancing security.
- mem: The memory cost parameter, set to 20480 KB (20 MB), specifies the amount of memory required for the hashing process. This makes it more resistant to attacks by increasing the resource requirements.
- hashLen: The length of the generated hash, set to 32 bytes, determines the size of the resulting password.
- parallelism: The parallelism parameter, set to 1, indicates the number of parallel threads used during hashing. This setting balances performance and security.

These values are chosen to ensure that the hash functions can be quickly computed by browsers on any device, providing a balance between security and performance. As an easy improvement for an alternative to the current system, the settings could be further increased (e.g., higher time and memory costs) to slow down potential attacks even more. However, this would be more suitable for users with powerful devices, as it would require more computational resources and time.

## Website Usage

### Selecting Nodes: Guide on how to choose and interact with animal nodes on the website.

I've designed the process of selecting and interacting with animal nodes on the website to be straightforward and intuitive. Here are the steps to effectively choose and interact with the animal nodes:

1. Selecting Animal Nodes:

For enhanced security, it's important to clear your clipboard and either close or reload the website after using your password. This prevents unauthorized access to your password. You can easily do this by clicking on the reset button, represented by the Pazoo logo, on the website.

## Future Reliability

_When choosing tools for password management or enhancement, one crucial factor to consider is their future reliability. It's essential to select a system that you can trust to remain effective and issue-free in the long term. In this section, I will detail how I conceived Pazoo with lasting reliability in mind, ensuring it remains a reliable choice for securing your digital life._

### System Stability

I have ensured that the core functionality of Pazoo remains unchanged. This means the system as it is will not change, ensuring that passwords generated previously remain valid and secure. Changes to the underlying processes could compromise the integrity of the passwords, which is why I prioritize a consistent and reliable approach.

### Simplicity

Pazoo's simplicity is fundamental to its long-term reliability. By maintaining a straightforward and uncluttered system, potential vulnerabilities that are common in more complex setups are minimized.

### Transparency

Transparency is a core principle of Pazoo, ensuring that both users and developers have complete visibility into how the tool operates. As an open-source project, all code is publicly available for anyone to review. This openness allows users to verify the integrity and security of Pazoo for themselves.

### Autonomy

I designed Pazoo so it can operate independently, free from external dependencies like servers or private infrastructures. This autonomy allows users to manage the tool on their own terms, whether by self-hosting it or reproducing it as needed. By eliminating reliance on external systems, Pazoo empowers users to take full control of their digital security.

### Alternatives

I conceived Pazoo to encourage the development of multiple alternatives as its user base grows. This strategy anticipates that as Pazoo gains popularity and potentially attracts hacker attention, the emergence of various alternatives will naturally dilute their focus. With each new variant, attackers must either spread their efforts across multiple targets or focus on just a few, making it increasingly challenging to exploit any single version. This proactive approach aims to enhance the security of the entire ecosystem over time as more alternatives are introduced and adopted.

## About me

### My vision

My primary goal with Pazoo is to help ensure that everyone's online accounts are secure. These accounts, which often hold sensitive data, represent our digital identities and require robust protection. By making password security more accessible and engaging, I hope to lower the barriers to effective security practices that are frequently overlooked.

I launched Pazoo knowing that it would not be the final solution in password security. It has plenty of room for improvement and may not remain the best option as future alternatives emerge. This is intentional. My aim wasn’t to create the ultimate, flawless tool, but to provide a foundation that others can build upon, innovate, and improve.

By offering Pazoo as a totally free and open-source project, I aim to establish trust and encourage others to contribute to its development. This collaborative approach is vital for adapting to the constantly evolving landscape of online security. I envision Pazoo as a stepping stone for others to develop even more sophisticated and effective security tools.

### Project Updates

Regarding updates to the system underlying Pazoo, it's important to note that I do not plan to update the system itself at this time. Should enhancements or new features be desired, the creation of an alternative based on the existing framework is encouraged. This strategy maintains the stability and security of the core system while allowing for innovation and adaptation through separate versions.

For updates related to the website, the most direct method is to contribute directly to the project. You can make changes or improvements and submit them via the GitHub repository. I periodically review submissions and integrate those that I find promising into the main project.

If you have suggestions for improvements or want to discuss potential updates, you are welcome to reach out to me on my Twitter account. However, please be aware that due to my commitments to other projects, I cannot guarantee a response or that I will personally implement the changes.
